TODO list:

* storage of best scores happens in user HOME directory.
  would be nice to have it readable/writable by the game
  for all users.

* order of xorcurses membership: provide an anagram (or
  other puzzle) a single part of which is provided on
  completion of each level. these parts (which would be
  single letters if puzzle is an anagram) would be
  obtained from a server rather than in-game.
  game would upload replay, server would
  corroborate it before returning puzzle-part.

* encryption: if not applied to all maps, at least, it
  should be applied to map 15 which visually, provides
  clues (ie how to convert letters) for solving the
  anagram. replays don't necessitate encryption.

* allow load of new maps - but this requires more
  complex handling of scores and replays, and
  tracking of map directories etc.
