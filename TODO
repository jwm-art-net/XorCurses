README 1ST
----------
I'm working on a xor 'game engine' library which
handles the game behaviour/processing side of things
seperate from any user interface.

The idea being that XorCurses2 will use this
library. And, for example, an SDL version -
XorSDL - will also use the same library
and so avoid code duplication.

So basically, development of XorCurses has stopped.
Only bug fixes as they are discovered are likely to
bring about new XorCurses releases.


TODO list:

* use autotools to generate ./configure script and make
  the code more portable. (hint: i need some help with
  this as I only have x86 and x86_64 to test with).

* find someone willing to make a debian package ;-)

* storage of moves happens in the user's HOME directory,
  would be nice to have it readable/writable by the game
  for all users - - - - maybe, who knows?

* when saving a reply have option to prevent continues
  from it.

* encrypt moves storage to avoid cheats.

* some kind of further puzzle - completion of each level
  provides a letter - rework The Decoder (15) for slight
  variation of original puzzle. (ie a variation on the
  puzzle to become a Member of Xor in the original game).

* restrict access to certain upper levels until certain
  other levels complete (ie bbc xor version does not allow
  access to maps 11,13,15 until 10,12,14 complete?? other
  versions for other computers differed here. possibly.
  (is this really necessary - i don't think so).

* track progress of level completion (in ~/.xorcurses)

* convert maps to binary format (such that the map pick-ups
  to view map don't require blah blah blah blah x blah y).
  also to prevent easy cheating and viewability of the clue
  in level 15.

* optimize/untangle code

* allow load of new maps.

* multi-coloured ASCII icons might be nice.
 (note: from work done in the ***LONG ABANDONDED*** icon editor
  a better way of doing the icons was discovered - rather than
  having a background colour and foreground colour and then
  char characters - use the chtype or'd with color_pairs and
  underline/bold attributes - multi-coloured icons seemed to
  confuse some icons (ie doll) and so i'm no longer concerned
  about it).

* experiment with larger icon sizes to at least see how it runs.
