README 1ST
----------
I _was_once_ working on a xor 'game engine' library which
handles the game behaviour/processing side of things
seperate from any user interface.

The idea being that XorCurses2 will use this
library. And, for example, an SDL version -
XorSDL - will also use the same library
and so avoid code duplication.

So basically, development of XorCurses has stopped.
Only bug fixes as they are discovered are likely to
bring about new XorCurses releases.


TODO list:

* debian and arch AUR packages please

* storage of moves taken to complete a level happens in
  the user's HOME directory - it would be nice to have
  it readable/writable by the game for all users.

* when playing a replay which is of a complete level,
  disallow continue play.

* encrypt moves storage to avoid cheats. possibly.

* some kind of further puzzle - completion of each level
  provides a letter - rework The Decoder (15) for slight
  variation of original puzzle. (ie a variation on the
  puzzle to become a Member of Xor in the original game).

* track progress of level completion (in ~/.xorcurses)

* convert maps to binary format (such that the map pick-ups
  to view map don't require blah blah blah blah x blah y).
  also to prevent easy cheating and viewability of the clue
  in level 15.

* optimize/untangle code

* allow load of new maps.

* keep it simple. one of the niceties of xorcurses is it's
  small footprint and simplicity. this is to remain.
