	* Oldschool difficulty setting: once replay has started,
	  replay must complete before player is allowed to resume
	  gameplay. Setting of breakpoints in replay is disallowed.
	  If a replay is loaded while in oldschool mode, breakpoints
	  are ignored.

	* Scroll Threshhold: when scroll threshhold is changed
	  (by pressing 1, 2, or 3 during play) visual feedback is
	  provided (scroll threshhold does not work in oldschool
	  mode).

	* control_flow.h, debug.h, player.h, replay.h: additional
	  helpers for displaying enum/bitfield information.

	* control_flow.[ch]: addition FLOW enum entry 

	* replay.c: fixed bugs allowing game play
	  continuation after player death or level complete/exit.
	  Corrected some menu entry names.

	* control_flow.h

	* version.h: deleted.
	  VERSION is now set in Makefile and passed compile time.

	* replace all instances of 'fprint(stderr, ...' wrapped by
	  '#if DEBUG' with 'debug(...'.

	* replace all instances of 'fprint(stderr, ...' NOT wrapped
	  by '#if DEBUG' with 'err_msg(...'.
