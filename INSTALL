PREREQUISITES:

    ncurses development package from your linux distro
    or ncurses built and installed from source.

    originally developed/built/tested in Debian Lenny with 
    ncurses-5.6, on both 32bit x86 and AMD64.

    recent development/testing in Arch Linux x86_64.

BUILDING:

Check the Makefile meets your requirements, and edit
if necessary - there is no configure script here.

tar -jxf XorCurses-0.2.2.tar.bz2
cd XorCurses-0.2.2
make
sudo make install
(or su -c make install)

If the build process fails, please contact the author
at james@jwm-art.net describing the problem. Please
make sure you have the development version of ncurses
installed from your distro as well as the ncurses binaries.

NOTES:

XorCurses now installs the maps and help files to
/usr/local/share/XorCurses. It expects to find them there.
Because the Makefile is quite primitive in how it handles
the install directories, you will have to rebuild XorCurses
and re-install it if you decide upon another location, the
defaults should be fine in most cases however.

Please view the README file for other help regarding XorCurses,
or press h when the game starts.

For tracking scores (ie minimum no. of moves taken to
complete a level) a file is written to $HOME/.xorcurses
If the environment variable $HOME does not exist, or its
content is garbage, or the file cannot be created, score
tracking will only work for as long as you have an instance
of XorCurses running.
