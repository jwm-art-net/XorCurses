XorCurses written by James W. Morris

      http://www.jwm-art.net/dark.php?p=XorCurses

Based on the game XOR by Astral Software (C) 1987

Xor is a puzzle game set inside a series of mazes.

XorCurses is a console/terminal ASCII character
game written for Linux in C and uses the ncurses
library.

BEWARE: The first three levels are easy. The next
two are a little more difficult, and the remainder get
progressively more difficult (or so I'm informed).

Xor does not give up his personality easily!

BUILDING
Please view the INSTALL file.

TERMINALS

There is/has been an occassional problem with XorCurses
running in some terminals when the terminal window is
resized. XorCurses seems to lag behind a resize
step. This behaviour has been spotted in other more
well established ncurses apps too.

** For best performance and completely functional **
** resizing, it is recommended XorCurses be       **
** played within an xterm window..                **

If you are running XorCurses in a terminal under
X then it is highly recommended that you increase
its size. This will allow a full detail map to be
shown as you play (instead of a rough approximation)
and the game display area will increase if you're
playing with the new school setting.


STARTING

In the level menu, use up/down arrow keys, or
press number keys 1 to 9 to select from the 
available levels.

Pressing d or D will change the difficulty. The old
school setting is more difficult: the game area is
restricted to 8x8 and the scrolling threshold is set
at 1 so you can't see so easily what is beyond your
player. Additionally, in oldschool mode, replays cannot
be interupted for play to resume from a point before the
replay otherwise would end. Breakpoints are also ignored.
The old school emulates the game play of the original
Xor game.


PLAYING

The object of each level is to collect all the
blue masks and find the exit!

Arrow keys move the currently selected player.
Enter switches between your two players.

Pressing q at any time during play will bring up
the replay menu. You can choose to actually quit
or watch the replay, or continue playing, amongst
other options. During replay press keys 1-9 to 
change speed, with 9 being very fast. Press s for
step mode, or, ( for hyper speed.

The replay can be used to go back to a point
before you made a wrong move.

In new school mode, you may also alter the scrolling
of the game area by pressing 1, 2 or 3. These
correspond to the number of blocks from the edge of
the screen which the player approaches to trigger
scrolling. The default is 2, Xor uses 1. 3
keeps the player central if the game area is 8x8.


FURTHER HELP

You can find further help by pressing h while
in the main level menu or during game play.
