New Release: XorCurses-0.1.3

* The oldschool difficulty level now prevents the player
  from interupting a replay and resuming play. This
  behaviour is inline with the original game.

* Visual feedback during game play when the scroll
  threshold is changed (by pressing keys 1, 2, or 3).

* Fixed bugs in replay handling allowing game play to
  continue after a replay where the level was completed
  or both players died.

* Added ChangeLog for developers.

* Git Repo https://github.com/jwm-art-net/XorCurses

New Minor Release: XorCurses-0.1.2

* Fixed nasty bugs in teleport code.

* Brought improvement to xor_move struct
  from XorGramana.

* Minor UI changes.

NOTES: I'm working on a 'game engine' for Xor
and Xor-like games which handles the game
processing stuff seperate from which ever
user interface is used for user input/output.

I've been doing this for a month or so and it's
gradually settling down into a stable form.

The hope is that one day I'll write an SDL
version of XorCurses. The engine has, in addition
to the objects in Xor, a few new objects with
intention being to create a 'home-brewed' sequel.

New Release: XorCurses-0.1.0

Substantial changes within XorCurses are
brought to you by this release. Most of
the changes and new features are a direct
result of implementing a 'breakpoint'
feature within the replay.


* Menus: a generic menu system is in place
  which is now used for the main level
  menu, a help menu, and a replay menu. The
  menu system supports all the old keyboard
  shortcuts, and other features necessary to
  get things right.

* Replays: breakpoints can be set so the replay
  will stop when it encounters them. This is
  helpful when using the replay to start play
  again from a point before it all went WRONG.
  Breakpoints can be set/unset by pressing 'b'
  during play, or from the replay menu during
  play and replays.  The replay menu makes the
  options clearer than the previous
  "Replay? (y/n/c/p/s)".

* Help: The main help file has been split into
  two sections, how to play the game, and keys.
  The object help still exists. Help can now
  be called upon while playing the game too.

* Pressing 'q' (quit) during game play no
  longer increments the number of moves.

* Source code: In order to implement the
  breakpoint feature, a new control_flow function
  was created. The old system of controlling
  program path between play/load replay/replay/play
  and back was messy and needed improving upon.
  Other source files have been split apart and
  etc etc.
